                                    Negril Beach, also known as Seven Mile Beach, is one of Jamaica's most beautiful stretches of white sand and aqua sea. Backed by the famous Negril Cliffs, it's also one of the best beaches in the Caribbean.
                                    <br>Although it's actually closer to four miles long, the beach extends from Bloody Bay to Long Bay. Tucked within groves of coconut palms, resorts fringe the shore here, from large all-inclusive resorts to smaller boutique properties.
                                    Water sports abound, and snorkelers will find schools of fish swimming in the clear waters.<br> But be prepared for persistent hawkers prowling the beach.
                                    South of the beach, the Negril Cliffs rise above the coral-fringed coast and provide a popular perch for sunset views. Jumping off these cliffs is also one of the top things to do in Negril.

                                <p>Rafting the Martha Brae is one of the most popular things to do in Jamaica - especially for couples. At Martha Brae Rafter's Village, you can glide down a picturesque stretch of the river on bamboo rafts poled by local guilty.
                                    <br>This relaxing trip is a great way to soak up some of the tropical scenery, and you can even stop at local vendors along the way to purchase souvenirs or refreshments. Best of all, some of the guides will entertain you during the trip, singing reggae songs or sharing interesting information about the flora and fauna.

                                <p>Encompassing 180 meters of gently terraced waterfalls, Dunn's River Falls is one of the top attractions in Ocho Rios. These picturesque falls tumble over rocks and limestone ledges into the sea.
                                    You can climb the natural tiers to the top of the falls with the aid of a guide and cool off in the refreshing pools at the base. <br>It's a good idea to wear water shoes and clothing that you don't mind getting wet. Also, try to plan your visit around the cruise ship crowds - this is one of Jamaica's most famous waterfalls, and it's a popular place to visit for tourists.
                                    For a fun full-day outing, try the Dunn's River Falls and Bob Marley's Nine Mile tour.</p><div class="Read" style="color:aquamarine;

                                    Set between mountains and a double harbor, Port Antonio exudes the relaxed charm of a sleepy fishing village. Once a center for banana export, the area is distinctly less commercial than the other resort towns.
Popular things to do in Port Antonio include hiking jungle trails, rafting the Rio Grande, taking a tour to Reach Falls, and snorkeling and diving the coral reefs.<br> A favorite swimming spot is the beautiful 60-meter-deep Blue Lagoon, fed by freshwater springs.
Other highlights of the area include the 18th-century British stronghold of Fort George and beautiful Frenchman's Cove, where a fish-filled river flows into the sea.<br>
Port Antonio beaches are a wonderful mix of white sand, shallow waters, and lush outcroppings of land.<br> But if you prefer to take a dip in freshwater, the nearby Daniel's River plunges through a gorge of natural rock in a series of cascades and pools known as Somerset Falls.

                            Located in the rustic parish of Portland, Reach Falls is definitely one of the best place to visit in Jamaica for nature and water-lovers. The falls and surrounding foliage are absolutely picturesque, the water is sparkling blue and refreshing, the staff are pleasant and there are sitting areas provided for large and small groups to picnic.

Be sure to ask for the guided tours of once-secret caves and paths slaves are believed to have trod through to avoid detection from their slave masters. Picking your way through the rocky foot paths and underground caves is the perfect combination of a little slice of history and adventure.

                            One of the best beaches in Montego Bay, Doctor's Cave Beach is an alluring strip of white sand fringed by clear waters.
                            This famous beach actually helped shape the fate of this popular tourist town. In the early 1920s, a famous British osteopath declared that the water had curative powers after swimming here, a claim that began to lure visitors from around the world. Hotels sprouted up, and the area became a thriving tourist destination.
                            The namesake cave was destroyed by a hurricane in 1932, but the beach is as popular as ever - hanging out here is one of the top things to do in Montego Bay, and it's often crowded with cruise ship passengers.
                            Change rooms, restaurants, and shops are all available nearby, and you can rent beach equipment here, too. Note that there's a fee to access the beach.

                            Outdoor enthusiasts and adventurers can test their skills kayaking and ziplining as they explore the Great River. Two-hour guided tours take guests kayaking through rolling rapids and calm waters, or ziplining above the river for a little adrenaline-infused adventure. A tour guide gives a safety and equipment briefing and offers insight into the wildlife and vegetation along the river.
The Jamaica Zipline and Kayak Adventure Tour, which departs from hotels in Negril and Montego Bay, includes hotel pickup and drop-off, lunch, equipment, a guide, and basic instruction. Participants must be at least six years of age.

                                The most significant hesitancy about camping is the worry of a rough night’s sleep. But with just a few essential items, and surrounded by the lack-of-blue-light in nature, it doesn’t take long for circadian rhythms to kick in for a stellar night's sleep.Tent, including tent body, rainfly, footprint, poles, stakes, and guy lines.Sleeping bag, with additional optional items like a sleeping bag liner, blanket, and camping pillow.Sleeping pad, an essential item that insulates the body from the ground.Warm clothes for lower nighttime temperatures and sleeping.

                                Only a fraction of waking time is spent in the tent. And while explorations are always encouraged outside the campsite, having a solid car camping setup ensures quality time around the campfire.
                                
                                1.Camp chair: foldable and lightweight preferred, bonus points for cup holders
                                2.Camp table: optional, as most campsites come equipped with a picnic table
                                3.Lantern and headlights: Two sources of light are always recommended at a minimum. Don’t forget fuel or batteries.
                                4. Appropriate clothing: Plan for all temperatures throughout the day.
