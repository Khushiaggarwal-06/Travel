<h1 style="font-size:60px;">history</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Ferrari is an Italian company which has produced sports cars since 1947, but traces its roots back to 1929 when Enzo Ferrari formed the Scuderia Ferrari racing team.

    Unlike many similar yet independent companies, Fiat Group-owned Ferrari continued to thrive after the death of its charismatic founder and is today one of the most successful sports car companies in the world. In January 2016, Ferrari officially split off from its former parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:40px;">Experience</h2>
<p style="font-size:25px;">The story of Ferrari begins in around 1929 when Enzo Ferrari formed Scuderia Ferrari, based in Modena, Italy. Scuderia Ferrari bought, repaired, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for "gentlemen drivers" and in 1933 took over Alfa Romeo's racing team. When Alfa Romeo brought its racing team back in-house in 1938, they hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department.

    In 1939, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo and agreed that he would not use the Ferrari name for races or racing cars for at least four years. He founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, to produce machine tools and aircraft accessories.</p>
